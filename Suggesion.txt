In this project I can also add Seven Segment display for count & show how many time
the push button is pressed.We can show the RGB number in Seven Segment display gradually 
increase/decrease.In this project, I use the DHT11 sensor. If I use the DHT22 sensor then
this system will improve the range and accuracy greatly. In this project, I use HUMIDITY
value but we can also find Temperature value. In this project we can also add LDR then this
system will measure luminosity. We can also add led. Adding led would improve the
clarity of the system. We can use the SIM900 module to send and receive sms from/to
the master Arduino. We can also add more Arduino Uno board then we do a lot of things.
We can add the ultrasonic sensor. We can add aÂ sensor that automatically does light on/off. 


There are lots of hardware could be added that do my system better performance.
